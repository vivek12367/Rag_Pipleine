# RAG Pipeline

This repository contains an implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline** designed to enhance generative AI models with external knowledge retrieval.

## 📌 Features
- Integrates **retrieval-based augmentation** to improve generative model responses.
- Uses **vector embeddings** for efficient document search and retrieval.
- Built with **Jupyter Notebook** for easy experimentation and visualization.

## 📂 Repository Structure

│── RAG_Pipeline.ipynb   # Jupyter Notebook implementing the RAG pipeline
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt` if available)

### Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vivek12367-rag_pipleine.git
   cd vivek12367-rag_pipleine
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook RAG_Pipeline.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the notebook cells to execute the pipeline.

## 📈 Business Use Cases
The RAG pipeline is highly valuable for solving corporate business problems, including:

- **Customer Support Automation**: Enhances chatbots with real-time knowledge retrieval from internal documentation to provide accurate responses.  
- **Market Research & Insights**: Aggregates and summarizes business reports, competitive intelligence, and trends from large unstructured datasets.  
- **Legal & Compliance Assistance**: Retrieves relevant policies, regulations, and compliance documents to assist legal teams with accurate information.  
- **Enterprise Knowledge Management**: Helps employees quickly find critical information from internal company repositories, reducing time spent on document search.  
- **Financial & Risk Analysis**: Analyzes and retrieves historical financial reports, news articles, and market trends to support decision-making.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** for scripting and model integration
- **Vector Databases** (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS) for retrieval
- **OpenAI API** for text generation
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive development
